 Because this is the cleanest version of the use cases we are using this table to describe the use cases accross all 3 of our documents
 
 The 5 use cases that i will be taking on myself are: 
  (Brief: Purchase, Review, Top Sales, View Purch Logs, Add Game-Store)
 (Casual:Purchase, Review, View Purch Logs)
 (fully Case: Purchase)

 4. the user will be prompted to choose what payment type ie. Card, Funds on account or BitCoin
 5. Once the user has chosen their payment method money is taken from the relevnt place and the transaction is complete
    5.1 if there is insufficiant funds in the users account an error message will show and the user will be taken back to the cart (for a swift telling off)
 6. games from the list will then be added to the users library
 
 Review
 0.1 One important pre requisite for this use case is that the user actually needs to have the game in their library before they can review

 2. user types in text box their review of the game
 3. user presses review button and the review is stored
 4. text box resets
